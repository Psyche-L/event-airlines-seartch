AS a frequent traveler

I WANT to see the upcoming dates, times, and available tickets for the event of my choosing. 

ALSO, I want to know the current weather forecast if it's available of the day and location of the event.

THEN I can search the weather of particular days and location.


GIVEN an event search page

I am presented with a navbar with “Search by Events” and “Current Weather.” and ten events that are close to my current location.

WHEN the user access the events page 

THEN is shown twelve cards near my location within 15 miles

WHEN I search for either event type, location, or date

THEN I am presented with ten cards labeling event type, date, time, and location of the event events relating to that event type, along with two buttons labeled book tickets and current weather.

WHEN the user access the page next time 

THEN they will remember the previous selection of event type and location

WHEN  I click the Book Ticket button, I am taken to the SeatGeek website

THEN I am presented with available tickets to purchase for the event.

WHEN I click on the Current Weather button 

THEN the user will be taken to the search flights page
